# UnProduct for Shopify
non-uniform test product data for the Shopify Platform. E-Commerce is a fast pace enviroment, and whilst we like to think that people will spend time carefully inputing product data, or even taking consistent product photos, that's not always the case.
This project will hopefully provide you with sample data that will test your theme or application with slight variants.

## How do I import?
These steps assume you've downloaded or cloned this project to your local computer already. Please make sure you are using a test Shopify Store and not a live one.

1. From your Shopify admin, click `Products`.
2. Click `Import`.
3. In the Import products by CSV file dialog, click `Choose File`.
4. Locate and select this CSV file on your computer, then click `Open`.
5. Check the `Overwrite existing products that have the same handle` checkbox. This will override any data that is on Shopify.
6. Click `Upload file`.

## Who's products are in this export?

1. Beast Mode

## Do you have explisit permission to use the products in this project?
No. I have not contacts the companies seeking permision, I'm banking on them being cool about this. Obviously they retain all copyright that is assosiated, and this project is for educational purposes only. _if you are from one of these companies and you do have a problem, I'll happily remove your products. Plz don't kill me with lawyers_.
